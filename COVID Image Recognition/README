This ongoing project attempts to distinguish among images of chest x-rays of COVID, viral pneumonia, and healthy patients. 
Over the course of the project, we will be developing several inital models, which will be whittled down to just one model. 
The remaining model will then be tuned to achieve the highest accuracy possible.

This folder contains the following files:

COVID Intial Model.ipynb                      Initial model with very few layers that achieved over 90% accuracy.


COVID_Pretrained_Models_First_Run.ipynb       Training and testing with pretrained models including ResNest50, DenseNet169, , VGG16, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2.
