The purpose of this project is to develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that generates music; 
specifically, it generates music after having been trained on popular 1990's band Rage Against the Machine (RATM). 

There are two files in this folder:


RATM_Music_Generator.ipynb                        The notebook containing the code for the RNN model.

ratm_rnn sample.mp3                               An mp3 file of the best sample that the model generated.
